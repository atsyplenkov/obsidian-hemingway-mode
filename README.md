# Obsidian Hemingway Mode Plugin
>[!note]
> This fork is a working version of the original plugin [jobedom/obsidian-hemingway-mode](https://github.com/jobedom/obsidian-hemingway-mode). I have just made small adjustments to the code to make the plugin compatible with Obsidian 1.8.* . All kudos should go to [@jobedom](https://github.com/jobedom/).

## Install

- Install manually by copying the release files (`main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css`) to `.obsidian/plugins/obsidian-hemingway-mode` in your vault.
