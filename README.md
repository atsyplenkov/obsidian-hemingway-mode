# Obsidian Hemingway Mode Plugin

> All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know.  
> (Ernest Hemingway)

A simple plugin for those who usually fight themselves to avoid editing while writing.

Hemingway mode will disable all keys that are involved in editing (cursor movement, backspace, cut shortcut, etc.) and will only allow adding text at the end of the current note.

The plugin adds a command `Hemingway Mode: Toggle active` which you can assign to a shortcut, to a button (using something like Commander) or you can just run using the command palette.

Hemingway mode when active will add a thin colored line at the top of the editor to give visual feedback. That line can be styled in the plugin settings, changing color and width.

Enjoy your writing!
